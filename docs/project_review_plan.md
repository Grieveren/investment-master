# Investment Master Project Review Plan

## Memory Management
- [ ] Implement pre-allocated memory pools instead of dynamic allocation
- [ ] Establish fixed-size buffers for data processing in portfolio_optimizer.py
- [ ] Use stack variables instead of heap allocation where possible
- [ ] Add boundary checks for all array accesses
- [ ] Implement safeguards against uninitialized memory use

## Error Handling
- [ ] Implement consistent error propagation throughout the codebase
- [ ] Replace generic exception catching with specific exception types
- [ ] Add detailed assertions in core functions (at least 2 per function)
- [ ] Create standardized error response format

## Code Structure
- [x] Refactor large functions in portfolio_optimizer.py to be under 60 lines
- [x] Break down complex formatting and calculation functions in portfolio_optimizer.py
- [x] Split analysis.py (1035 lines) into smaller modules
- [ ] Implement stricter data encapsulation
- [ ] Minimize variable scope to smallest required context

## Test Coverage
- [ ] Expand unit tests to cover all core functions with proper assertions
- [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Implement property-based testing for financial calculations
- [ ] Create regression test suite for critical functionality

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Use bounded iterations with clear upper limits in analysis loops
- [ ] Implement static analysis of algorithmic complexity
- [ ] Optimize memory access patterns in data processing functions
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical operations

## Dependencies
- [ ] Update requirements.txt with specific version constraints
- [ ] Add missing dependencies used in the code
- [ ] Consider packaging the application properly with setup.py
- [ ] Document external dependencies and their purposes

## API Security
- [ ] Strengthen API key management beyond .env files
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- [ ] Add input validation for all external data sources
- [ ] Create audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Compilation and Analysis
- [ ] Add static type annotations throughout the codebase
- [ ] Implement continuous static analysis with strict warnings
- [ ] Enable all compiler/linter warnings
- [ ] Add automated code quality checks

## Metaprogramming
- [ ] Replace complex uses of metaprogramming with direct code
- [ ] Limit dynamic code generation practices
- [ ] Document any necessary metaprogramming clearly

## Documentation
- [ ] Add function-level documentation with pre/post conditions
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams showing system components
- [ ] Document memory model and resource management
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide

## Benefits
These improvements will provide:
- Improved reliability and system stability
- Faster analysis performance
- More accurate financial recommendations
- Enhanced security for financial data
- Future-proof platform for adding features
- Lower, more predictable resource usage
- Better maintainability for future development
- Verifiable results with higher confidence
